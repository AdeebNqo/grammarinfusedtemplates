# OWLSIZ

OWL Simplified isiZulu (OWLSIZ) is an isiZulu controlled natural language. It is designed for generating grammatical and fluent questions from an ontology. The purpose is to allow a domain expert to independently validate the contents of an ontology without understanding a ontology authoring language such as OWL.
